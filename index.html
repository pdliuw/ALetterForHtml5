            <em>Dear Eileen,</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science to study as part<br>
            of your <abbr title="Phone Develop">PhD</abbr> next year.I will answer your questions one by one,in the
            following sections.
        </p>
        <h3>Staring dates</h3>
        <p>
            We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
            you <br>
            could start at the beginning of a semester;the start dates for each one are as follows;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester:9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester:15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester:2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">import university dates</a></p>
        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher,and
            just<br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most
            intrigued <br>
            by are as follows,in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratrol(
                C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
            </li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30℃(86℉),when the<br>
                audience size exponentially increases(effect of3 x 10<sup>3</sup> &gt;3 x 10<sup>4</sup>. )
            </li>
            <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                constructs for representing musical scores.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long you'd expect the<br>
            research to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.
        </p>

        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p>
            Yes,you are right!As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your
            question,<br>
            my favorite dances are as follows,with definitions:
        </p>
        <p>
            Polynesian chicken dance<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little known but very influential dance dating back as far sa 300<abbr title="BC">BC</abbr>
            ,a whole village would dance around<br>
            in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".<br>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to
            practice this dance, which<br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br>
            tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
            modem style such as Twerking.<br>
            Arctic robot dance<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s
            believed to have<br>
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitants<br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
            because they were really cold.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            For more of my research,see my <a href="http://example.com/">exotic dance research page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
        <br>
